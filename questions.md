# What is the convention for naming classes in CSS?
    The convention for naming classes in CSS is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) which is a popular way programers adopted for naming with prefixes, underscores and dashes.
    exemple: class="b-li-color"

# What is one way to stop a form from submitting with JavaScript?
    The event.preventDefault() function stops default behavior for tags in an HTML document. For a form, calling event.preventDefault() on the "onSubmit" parameter would stop it from submission.

# When should HTML code be validated?
    HTML code should always be validated for both user experience (UX) and code maintainability reasons. Regarding UX, HTML code should display properly on any browser. If HTML is written and not following correct standards, it could cause weird bugs and display content incorrectly for users of different browsers. To maintain HTML code, it is always easier to be following the validated, accepted practice, because teams in long-term development will always be able to work on it. Unvalidated code can cause problems for teams with changing team members, and developers who don't stick to "one style" of html and return to their code after a long time.

# What is the DOM? Please elaborate on this question.
    The "Document Object Model", referred to as the DOM, is an interface, specifically an API, that browsers use to render HTML code. The DOM is where a lot of hard work is done by the browser to define the structure of webpages from provided code, finding the logical way to construct a tree of elements that make up the DOM as a whole. The DOM "models" how data is rendered on the browser depending on how provided documents (such as HTML and XML) want to display their information. While the DOM looks very much like the code that we provide to it, it is different because it is the interpretation of the code by the browser. This is why sometimes what we see in chrome developer tools looks different from HTML we write, because the browser can interpret things such as HTML mistakes in a different way than we intend to.

# Which one is better: CSS Grid, Flexbox or just plain CSS?
    It depends on what/where/how you want to place your items. CSS Grid and CSS flex-box are complementary web layouts, the first being container-based and the second being content-based. One of the biggest differences about them is in how they arrange their elements in rows and columns, flexbox is best for arranging elements in either a single row, or a single column while grid is best for arranging elements in multiple rows and columns. 
    Plain CSS takes more work and time, and it's easier to make mistakes.
